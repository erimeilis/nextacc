 * Use these hooks instead:
 * - useWaitingDids() - fetch waiting DIDs
 * - useConfirmWaitingDid() - confirm a waiting DID
 * - useDeleteWaitingDid() - delete a waiting DID
 * - useWaitingDidSettings() - get settings for a specific DID
 * - useUpdateWaitingDidSettings() - update settings for a specific DID
 *
 * Import from: '@/hooks/queries/use-waiting-dids'
 *
 * This file is kept for reference during migration.
 * It will be deleted once all components are migrated.
